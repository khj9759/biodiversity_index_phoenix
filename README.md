## Title or description 
Biodiversity Intactness Index change in Phoenix subdivision

## About
In 2021, Maricopa County, part of Phoenix's metropolitan area, saw the largest increase in developed land in the US since 2001. Urban growth pressures biodiversity. We analyze a biodiversity dataset (BII) to track BII changes near Phoenix from 2017 to 2020.

## Visualization
After analyzing geospatial and STAC datasets, we have generated a map that highlights the Phoenix subdivision and showcases the area where BII>= 0.75 in 2017. You can find this map stored in the image/ directory. 

## Highlight
- Counting pixels employing NumPy functions
- Handling geospatial raster datasets for reading and writing with rioxarray
- Manipulating geospatial data using geopandas
- Generating maps utilizing contextily
- Creating and customizing SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) maps

## Data
1) Biodiversity Index in Phoenix City, Arizona
2) Arizona State Map: Census data - https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2022&layergroup=County+Subdivisions
